# American-Sign-Language-Classifier
This project aims to create a working model to classify images based on hand gestures. We propose a convolutional neural network to classify such images. For this project the main focus is on american hand sign language. The dataset for this project was created and cleaned, pre-processed and then used for training the model combined with the existing dataset.

Programming Language Use: Python

Tools and Libraries Used: Anaconda, CNN, OpenCV, Pytorch, Numpy
